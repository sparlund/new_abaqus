## new_abaqus
new_abaqus is a hobby project for creating an FE-solver reading an FE-mesh following the syntax of the commercial software abaqus. 

The name is a joke from the character YinYang in Silicon Valley, who has the idea for "new netflix".

### Features implemented


   
### TODO
- [x] Implement logic and structure for reading abaqus input files~~
- [x] Set up classes and functions for nodes, elements, properties and materials~~
- [x] Implement stiffness matrix contirbution for 2D tria element~~
- [ ] Implement logic for 3D shell element
- [x] Assemble stiffness matrix for generic elements~~
- [x] Boundary condition keywords~~
- [x] Point load keyword and assemble global load vector~~
- [ ] Solve for displacement
- [ ] Solve eigen value problem
- [ ] Make file
- [ ] Automate test cases for comparison solution against CALFEM and or abaqus
